# REGFuck
REGFuck is a tool that can corrupt your Windows Registry, leading to all sorts of different effects, including weird themes, errors and of course totally destroyed systems.

It lets you configure a global chance of corruption and relative chances to different root keys of the registry. It also has a chance to delete values instead of corrupting random data inside of them.

There is the ability to re-use random seeds, however, it is useless, because it depends on the layout of your registry, meaning, on a different system you won't get the same results with the same seed.

The GUI is redesigned by me :). Also, I did not change a single default control name (yea i didn't).

So the tool won't be developed anymore, i'll continue to develop it(if possible because i'm bad)

Leurak is working on a totally new tool, made just for destroying Windows and featuring lots of new stuff, including PE (exe file) corruption, plugin support and a GUI that makes sense.
